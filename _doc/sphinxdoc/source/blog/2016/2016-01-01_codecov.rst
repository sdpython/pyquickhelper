    *pyquickhelper* is using `coverage <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/coverage>`_
    to measure the coverage of the unit tests.
    `coveralls <https://coveralls.io/>`_ cannot ingest these reports
    when `codecov <https://codecov.io/>`_ does with a simple command line such as::

        codecov --token=69193a28-dc79-4a24-98ed-aedf441a8249
                --file=D:\jenkins\pymy\_pyquickhelper\_doc\sphinxdoc\source\coverage\coverage_report.xml
                --commit=f30c095f5da096e5db2ba6e5e0f7e07e833a8c81

    It is provided by module `codecov <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/codecov/1.5.1>`_
    (or `github/codecov <https://github.com/codecov/codecov-python>`_).
    The coverage report is also available at
    `pyquickhelper coverage <http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyquickhelper/helpsphinx/coverage/index.html>`_.
    but these kinds of website keep track of the changes. Others available websites
    which provide badges are mentioned on the main page
    `pyquickhelper <http://www.xavierdupre.fr/app/pyquickhelper/helpsphinx/index.html>`_.
