    Taking another dependency always means a potential
    conflicts between version. Is it fact enough updated
    when it breaks? I realized I was not the only to face an
    issue with `sphinx-gallery <>`_.
    There is a discussion about it on
    `scikit-learn/9189 <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/issues/9189>`_
    and the package is now included in the
    `sources <https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/tree/master/doc/sphinxext/sphinx_gallery>`_.
    It is not really bothering for a small package like this.
    But still, it is extra work.
    I realize open source holds on some kind of magic
    sometimes. Some are fun but keeping them alive
    takes some energy.
