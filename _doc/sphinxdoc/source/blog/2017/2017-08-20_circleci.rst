    *pyquickhelper* now builds on
    `CircleCI <https://circleci.com/gh/sdpython/pyquickhelper>`_.
    The list of unit tests enabled on that platform is bigger than on
    *travis* or *appveyor*. It also builds the wheel and the documentation.
    It pushed them into the artifacts section where they can be downloaded.
    You can see the installation step in file
    `.circleci/config.yml <https://github.com/sdpython/pyquickhelper/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml>`_.
