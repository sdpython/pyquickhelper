    :title: Anaconda does not have the latest version of Sphinx

    As of today, when I type ``conda update sphinx``,
    The Anaconda distribution does not upgrade to 1.3
    and I need it to get the extension
    *sphinx.ext.napoleon*. So I need to type
    ``pip install sphinx --upgrade`` instead.
